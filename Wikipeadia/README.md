# DETECTING VANDALISM ON WIKIPEDIA

One of the consequences of being editable by anyone is that some people vandalize pages. This can take the form of
removing content, adding promotional or inappropriate content, or more subtle shifts that change the meaning of the
article. With this many articles and edits per day it is difficult for humans to detect all instances of vandalism
and revert (undo) them. As a result, Wikipedia uses bots - computer programs that automatically revert edits that look like
vandalism. In this assignment we will attempt to develop a vandalism detector that uses machine learning to distinguish
between a valid edit and vandalism.
